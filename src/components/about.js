                                Welcome to my page! My name is Dyllan, and I'm a software engineer. I recently graduated
                                from Oregon State University with my BS in Computer Science. More recently, I started
                                working as a Back-End Developer with Sporcle. I generally prefer back-end development, 
                                but I also enjoy mobile development. I pride myself on being a team player and am always 
                                striving to improve my skill set. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
                            </p>
