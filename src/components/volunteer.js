                            <p>
                                Volunteered in a school for children with disabilities. Most of my time here was spent working with a young girl, Eva, who had 
                                both of her legs amputated. Myself and other volunteers arranged for Eva to receive a pair of prosthetic legs. I then worked with
                                Eva for the next two months teaching her how to use and walk with her new prosthetics. Of all my experiences listed on this page,
                                this was by far the most impactful and rewarding experience.
